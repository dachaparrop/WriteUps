## Solution

### Ports Enumeration

We start with my prefer port enumeration, with the `nmap` command:

```sh
sudo nmap -p- -sS -Pn --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -oG allPorts.txt 10.129.231.219
```

We discover these open ports:

```java
PORT      STATE SERVICE      REASON
22/tcp    open  ssh          syn-ack ttl 63
53/tcp    open  domain       syn-ack ttl 63
80/tcp    open  http         syn-ack ttl 63
1557/tcp  open  arbortext-lm syn-ack ttl 63
32400/tcp open  plex         syn-ack ttl 63
32469/tcp open  unknown      syn-ack ttl 63
```
We see that a web service is running in the port `80` and a service named `plex` running in the port `32400`. Now let's analyze deeper the services and versions with this command:

```sh
sudo nmap -p 22,53,80,1557,32400,32469 -Pn -sVC --min-rate 5000 -oN puertos.txt 10.129.231.219
```
#### parameters explanation
+ -p- : Scans all possible ports (1 - 65535)
+ -sS : (stealth Scan) Sends SYN packets and waits for a response, it's faster and stealthier than a full TCP scan
+ -Pn : no `ping` command is performed, so the scan was doing without checking if the machine responds to ICMP pings
+ --min-rate 5000 : Sets a minimum rate of `5000` packets per second (the more packets, the faster, but noisier and more detectable)
+ -vvv : More verbosity, you can see the ports discovering in the process
+ -n : Skips DNS resolution, speeding up the scan
+ -oG puertos.txt : Saves the scan results in a grepable format (easy to filter and use the `grep` command) in the file `"puertos.txt"`
+ 
  
```java
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION

```


### Web enumeration

Okay, after exploring the web services in both ports, we see that the one in the port `80` doesn't have anything (the main page is empty, but we can do directory/subdomain enumeration later) and in the `Plex` , because after sign in, we can see the version of the service: 

![1](./assets/1.png)

And after using `searchsploit`, it doesn't appear to be vulnerable:  

![2](./assets/2.png)

Now let's do a directory discovery with the tool `gobuster`, we start with the port `80` (it's the default one, so we don't have to specify the `:80` after the ip):

```sh
gobuster dir -u http://ipExample -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -o fuzzWebDir.txt -t 50 
```
#### parameters explanation
+ dir : This is the option to execute a `direction discovery` in `gobuster`
+ -u : Sets the ip of the we service
+ -w : Sets the wordlist dictionary to use in the bruteforcing process
+ -o : Save the content of the directory discovery
+ -t : Number of current threads the process will use (default: 10)

After discovering the `/admin` directory, where we find a login for the service `Pi-hole`, we could try a simple thing, looking for default credentials online, but after trying different passwords for the login that didn't work, we find credentials for a ssh login:

Let's try it:

![5](./assets/5.png)


And we are in!!, now we can see the user flag in `/home/pi/Desktop/user.txt` and sanitize the terminal (You can learn how to do it here üêá: https://uqbarun.github.io/blog/fundamentos/2023/11/19/sanitizacion-de-tty-por-conexion-remota)

### Privileged escalation / Linux enumeration

Now we have to escalate privileges in order to be root, let's start with a simple enumeration with `sudo -l`:

![6](./assets/6.png)

wut? Apparently we can execute any commands with sudo, so we can use `sudo su` to become **root**:

![7](./assets/7.png)

It's not that easy uh? They gave us a hint though, in Linux we can verify devices with storage with the command `df`, also we can use `mount` (with this one we have to grep to reduce content, like this: `mount | grep "usb"`):

![8](./assets/8.png)

Inside the `/media/usbstick/` we can see the `"damnit.txt"` file:

![9](./assets/9.png)

He deleted it? Let's see the content inside `/dev/sdb` (we must use the command `strings`, because with `cat` the content is not printed human-readable)

![10](./assets/10.png)

And we got the flag!! üêá
